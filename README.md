# Structure
This repo is divided into a lib folder, with a file containing the solution to the coding test, and a spec folder with the tests which helped me create my solution. 

# Test Driven Development
First I wrote my unit tests, to guide the methods I would write inside checkout.rb

Once the tests were up and running, I began writing out my solution to the problem. 

# Test the Solution
To test my solution yourself run the following in your terminal:

    rspec spec/checkout_spec.rb
